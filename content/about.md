Hi, you've reached my website. I'm Ismail Badawi. I currently work as a
software engineer at a big technology company called Cisco Systems. Previously
I was a graduate student at McGill University, where I did compiler stuff for
MATLAB as part of [the McLab project][mclab]. I also interned at Google a
couple of times along the way.

If you'd like to get in touch with me for any reason, the best method is
[email][]. I can also be found on [github][] and [stackoverflow][].
